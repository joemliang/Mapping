Mapping
=======

The R code generate the geo-distribution of conflicts in Africa (Darker areas have more conflicts), and map the conflicts on a Google map:

* mapping.png shows each conflict in Africa. 
* all bw.png shows the geo-distribution of conflicts in Africa.

Data Source: Uppsala Conflict Data Program (UCDP)
